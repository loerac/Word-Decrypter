# Word-Decrypter
Enter a word that is encrypted in a substitution format and enter known letters that are in and not in the word. The wordlist and the cpp file need to be in the same folder.

I added code a while back and it got got really buggy and I forgot what I changed. This program is also one of my first programs and it is god awful messy. The bugs will be fixed soon.
